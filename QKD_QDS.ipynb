    "# Quantum Identity-Based Signature (QIBS) with BB84 Key Exchange\n",
    "This code simulates a Quantum Identity-Based Signature (QIBS) scheme, a sophisticated method for verifying the authenticity and integrity of a digital message using quantum mechanics. The simulation integrates two core quantum algorithms: the BB84 protocol for secure key distribution and a quantum signature protocol where a user's identity is directly used for verification. The purpose is to demonstrate a complete and secure workflow from key generation to signature verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation follows these key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Establishing a Secure Key with the BB84 Protocol\n",
    "The process begins with two parties, Alice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver), generating a shared secret key using the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. This ensures that their communication key is secure from eavesdroppers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preparation: Alice generates a random string of classical bits and a random string of quantum bases (either the computational Z basis {∣0⟩,∣1⟩} or the Hadamard X basis {∣+⟩,∣−⟩}). She encodes her bits onto qubits according to her chosen bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Measurement: Bob receives the qubits and measures each one using his own randomly chosen string of bases (Z or X).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sifting: Alice and Bob publicly compare their basis choices for each qubit. They discard all measurements where their bases did not match. The remaining, correctly-measured bits form their shared, sifted key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Security Check: They compare a small subset of their sifted keys to calculate the Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER). A QBER above a certain threshold (e.g., 11%) indicates the presence of an eavesdropper, and the key is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: User Registration with a Trusted Authority\n",
    "A central, trusted entity called the Secret Key Generator (SKG) is responsible for managing user identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sender, Alice, is registered with the SKG. The SKG stores two secret pieces of information linked to her identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "The shared key generated via the BB84 protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unique secret angle ϕ, which serves as her quantum identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Signature Creation by the Sender (Alice)\n",
    "To sign a classical message (e.g., 32191, which is 111110110101111 in binary), Alice creates a quantum signature package consisting of two quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Message State ∣P⟩: She first encodes the classical binary message into a multi-qubit quantum state. For each 1 in the message, she applies an X gate to the corresponding qubit. This creates the original message state ∣P⟩.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Signature State ∣S⟩: This state is created in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identity Transformation: Alice applies a unique unitary transformation U(π/2,ϕ,0) to every qubit in the message state ∣P⟩. This transformation is parameterized by her secret identity angle ϕ. This mathematically binds her identity to the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encryption: She then encrypts the transformed state using the Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP). This is done by applying Z and X gates to the qubits based on the bits of the shared BB84 key, making the state unreadable without the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Signature Verification by the Recipient and SKG\n",
    "To verify the signature, the recipient (Bob) forwards the signature package (∣P⟩ and ∣S⟩) along with Alice's ID to the SKG. The SKG performs the verification by reversing Alice's steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information Retrieval: The SKG looks up Alice's ID in its registry to retrieve her secret key and secret angle ϕ.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decryption: It applies the inverse of the QOTP to the signature state ∣S⟩ using the retrieved key.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inverse Transformation: It then applies the inverse of the identity transformation using the retrieved angle ϕ.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparison: If the signature is authentic and untampered, this process will perfectly recover the original message state ∣P⟩. The SKG compares the state vector of the recovered state with the original ∣P⟩. If they are identical, the signature is valid. Otherwise, it is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Tampering Detection\n",
    "The simulation includes a final security test where an X gate is applied to a random qubit in the signature state ∣S⟩ to simulate tampering. The verification process is run again, and it correctly identifies the signature as invalid, demonstrating the scheme's robustness against modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "This simulation demonstrates the core principles of an advanced quantum-secure communication scheme:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provable Security: The key exchange is secured by the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics (like the no-cloning theorem) through the BB84 protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identity-Based Cryptography: A user's identity is directly used as a cryptographic parameter (the angle ϕ), simplifying key management compared to traditional public-key systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authentication and Integrity: The verification process guarantees that the message was signed by the legitimate sender (authentication) and has not been altered in transit (integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confidentiality: The Quantum One-Time Pad ensures that the signature state remains confidential during transmission.\n",
    "\n",
