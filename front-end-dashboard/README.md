# Frontend Dashboard â€” README

Simple instructions to run the simulation locally.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (LTS recommended). Node 16+ or 18+ will work.
- **npm** (comes with Node). You can also use `yarn` if you prefer.

---

## Quick start

1. Clone or copy the project folder to your machine.

2. Open a terminal and `cd` into the project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

> If you use `yarn`:

```bash
yarn install
```

> If the project is missing `@mui` or `framer-motion` for any reason, install them:

```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

(or `yarn add ...`)

4. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the React app and open (or make available) `http://localhost:3000`.

5. Open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Now you can interact with the simulator.
